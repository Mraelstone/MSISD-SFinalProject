## Our Project: Build an app for Oconee Fire Department

We are Team 6 (BigRed0100) building a web app for Oconee Fire Department to help manage their firefighters and their certifications among other things.

The technology stack included HTML/CSS/Javascript for the front end, Apache for the web server, PHP for the application layer and MySQL for the database. The database is hosted on Amazon RDS and the application is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.

Linked here is the EC2 server that the application is hosted on: ec2-52-87-43-243.compute-1.amazonaws.com 

Thanks and enjoy!
